Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the use of the COMPAS algorithm in parole decision-making. The project explores both the statistical and philosophical implications of using the COMPAS risk assessment tool, which is widely used in the criminal justice system to predict recidivism. The analysis critically evaluates whether judges should rely on COMPAS scores in their parole decisions, given concerns about fairness, bias, and ethical considerations.

Key Topics Covered:
Statistical fairness metrics (e.g., statistical parity, equalized odds, disparate impact)
Ethical frameworks (e.g., deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics)
Analysis of COMPAS's effectiveness and limitations
Recommendations for judicial decision-making
